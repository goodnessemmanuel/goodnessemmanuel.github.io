        We are Agile, We Iterate
      </h3>
      <p>
        Agile Engineering serve as actual backbone for developing software in an agile way. Currently, our project or program delivery
        happens through different working processes within Agile world. Whilst the umbrella of all of Agile processes is really organization
        centric, we have extensively applied our Agile principles based on Scaled Agile Framework which in other words called as SAFe. Under
        SAFe Agile, we have applied the principles of scrum, XP, Kanban and DevOps across projects we deliver.

      <p>
        At a high-level, SAFe allows the organizations to be self-disciplined by having to work through different complexities of involving
        different practices, but the outcomes are yet focused on the following:

        Project delivery via eXtreme Programming process
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Extreme Programming discipline at Hexad works on certain rich Lean start-up principles that are adopted by our product teams, as
        we continue to focus on our Minimum Viable Product, Value Proposition, and Business Model through an iterative product development
        lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping XP principles in mind, we have adapted Extreme Programming discipline with lean start-up mentality and the attitude of quick
        discoveries or problem-solving techniques and learning with the process of Build-Measure-Learn lifecycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Scrum ceremonies are heavily adopted as we have always believed its core values and its significance to projects we deliver
        every day
      </p>
      <img src="{{'/assets/images/scrum-1.jpeg' | prepend: site.baseurl}}" class="w-100 img-fluid rounded py-5" alt="{{page.title}}"/>
      <p>
        Our intuition is that the scrum practices can be applied to moderately smaller teams measuring up to not more than 2 to 3 teams on
        an average.
      </p>
      <p>
        The focus of Scrum is rather focused on customer interactions, collaboration over working documentation, increased team
        accountability, and well-defined product backlog to keep the team busy at work
      </p>
      <p>
        In our portfolio of projects, there is Scrum applied throughout the planning & execution that transmits into delivered product at
        the end of the day.
      </p>

      <p>
        We work closely with Volkswagen on the execution of these processes across the projects we deliver. As much as we admire the
        existence of Scrum and XP, we have thought-provoking leaders within the teams who are fundamentally inclined to practice newer
        techniques in order to improve our working quality every day.
